# Ethos MD5SUM UI Examples and Mockups

## Main Screen After Authenticating And Logging In
This is an idea of the main screen layout.  There are many similarities to the layout of popular websites.  This main page is a collection of several different modules and should be coded in a way that other modules from the Ethos Project can also plug into them. Some of the sections within this main screen can be opened up in their own separate utility doing the same thing but on a bigger scale.  There should be a master account (md5admin) created that has superpower permissions.  This account can then add addtional users that can log into the AI. Eventually, there will be a PERMISSIONS.md file created to set permissions up.

### Image Breakdown And Sections Explained

Additional UI screens will be placed here as well so that the agent has an idea of what each section or module should do.
