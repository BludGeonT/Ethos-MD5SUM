# TASK.md
A living document used by AI Agents to keep track of tasks that are completed and yet to be completed.

# Tasks To Complete
These are tasks that need to be completed and can be added and removed by Replit AI agents as work progresses.  The tasks should each start with a dash ( - ) to create a bullet point for easy readability.

- TASK: Example task one where things that need to be completed can be tracked and planned for.
